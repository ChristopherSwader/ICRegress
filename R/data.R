#' A data frame with 720 rows 16 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{method}{Method applied to the same underlying data set and ground assumptions.}
#'   \item{weighted r2}{A weighted R-squared value, where the weights depend on the proportion of overall cases in the separate model subgroups.}
#'   \item{discrete solution}{The discrete solution based on the target solution threshold. An alternative parameter used to initially tune the ICR genetic algorithm.}
#'   \item{case assignment score}{A higher score represents that the found subgroups accurately reflect the underlying ground truth of the fake data.}
#'   \item{model similarity error}{A lower model error indicates that the identified models more closely reflect the underlying ground truth of the fake data's models.}
#'   \item{seed}{A random seed.}
#'   \item{generations}{The number of generations used for training for the ICR method's genetic algorithm. Not relevant for the comparison methods.}
#'   \item{solution_thresh}{The threshold on each side of the solution that is considered discretely solved during the training phase.}
#'   \item{n_dna_strands}{The number of models preserved after each generation of training.}
#'   \item{real_model_n}{Underlying number of true models and subgroups of the underlying ground truth fake data.}
#'   \item{N_IVs}{Underlying number of true model-relevant independent variables of the underlying ground truth fake data.}
#'   \item{error_sd}{Underlying error of the ground truth separate subgroups and models. More error indicates messier data.}
#'   \item{test_set_model_closeness}{Deprecated. This is no longer in use as a parameter.}

#' Data from the 2016 European Social Survey

#' An extract of cross-sectional data from the 2016 European Social Survey data is used in order to demonstrate the use of the ICR Method for educational purposes.
#' Full documentation of the ESS and its data are available on its website: https://ess-search.nsd.no/en/study/f8e11f55-0c14-4ab3-abde-96d3f14d3c76.
#' Included variables are a limited selection of those with a theoretical and empirical relationship to happiness.
